						&nbsp;<font color="#333333">Tom Turner�a workshop on DVD<br>
						<br>
						It�s not everyday we see an person with over 40 years of
						experience sit down and let it all flow. But in this 6
						hour presentation Tom Turner shares his wealth of
						knowledge in exacting detail and covers every aspect of
						the potters� art. Because he speaks so well (no ums, ers
						or ya�knows) he is fully understandable and easy to
						listen to. He has complete thoughts expressed in
						complete sentences within full paragraphs - yet truly
						extemporaneous. The material is dense in some places so
						you may need to take notes. It seems he has never
						forgotten anything he has learned or from whom he
						learned it. As he gives credit where it is due, he
						weaves a nice little history of much of American
						ceramics and studio pottery.<br>
						<br>
						If it is technical information you seek, here it is. But
						Turner spends just as much time on meaning as he does
						method and the entire DVD is richly illustrated with
						examples of work in progress as well as completed
						pieces, these last his personal collection of the past
						four decades.<br>
						<br>
						To say Turner is thoroughly in command of his processes
						and materials is no exaggeration. His motto might be
						tighten up america, but he is quick to point out his way
						is just that and not necessarily suited to others. What
						any viewer can extrapolate, however, is that there is no
						detail in pottery that can�t provide a payoff. For
						example, he polishes his lids in order to secure the fit
						AND improve the audible tone when they sit. <br>
						<br>
						Understandable, complete and worth seeing repeatedly if
						you want to extract it all. <br>

						<font color="#333333">Tom, <br>
						<br>
						Thank you for creating a video that is truly the next
						best thing to being at the workshop itself. The
						production quality is outstanding. The video and sound
						are exceptionally clear and one can�t help but feel as
						though �you are in the room�. <br>
						<br>
						Your relaxed laid back style of presentation and method
						of working is a pleasure to watch. Your love and
						knowledge of porcelain clearly shows in everything you
						create and discuss in the workshop. I can�t comprehend
						how you can remember so many details when answering
						questions. Your expertise is unmistakable.<br>
						<br>
						The last disc which spotlights your favorite pots is the
						perfect signature for the workshop. I have admired your
						work for many years and would have to describe it as
						simply exquisite. Your pots as with all art will affect
						everyone differently. For myself they show the purity
						and a certain sensual smoothness which porcelain best
						portrays. I immediately want to touch them. <br>
						<br>
						As someone living somewhat isolated and who is almost
						completely self taught through books, workshops, videos,
						and simply having a love for clay, this production is
						the perfect learning tool for me. I�m sure I�ll watch it
						repeatedly and the next time I�m taking notes. Thanks
						again.<br>

						<font color="#333333">Hi Tom, <br>
						<br>
						Well I finally got the DVDs and I am really impressed
						with them. Not only did I learn a lot, I also feel like
						I know you. It was great to hear someone going through
						the same frustrating, time running out dilemma that I
						have been feeling. But the filming and the editing were
						very well done. I wish I could have heard more of the
						participant�s comments, which is my only complaint. You
						are without a doubt one of the nicest most informing
						people I have ever known, you are a great teacher. I
						have several videos and DVDs and I can guarantee you I
						will go back to yours several times. Being a teacher
						myself I can�t wait to share these with some of my adult
						students. <br>
						<br>
						Bye for now and thanks again.<br>

						<br>
						What a pleasure it has been to watch your DVDs!!! And to
						watch you and see the total familiarity of the porcelain
						inspires, and I enjoyed seeing the attention to detail.
						I can easily see that the attention to detail is tedious
						and time consuming. You make it look so easy. You are
						very good at explaining the processes in your DVDs. I
						was totally lost whenever you talked about glazes and
						formulas, but still, I could tell that you were very
						clear to the participants at the workshop. I plan to
						watch these videos over and over trying to absorb the
						many techniques that you use while throwing and
						perfecting your pots. I think the best thing I could say
						to sum it up is that I want more. <br>

						<font color="#333333">Tom Turner's DVD set is something you should get for
						yourself, your potter's group, or for your school. This
						professionally filmed and edited four disc set covers a
						wide range of topics and lasts almost six hours. Tom
						demonstrates throwing, trimming, decorating, assembled
						pots, and talks about glazing and firing techniques.
						There is information for beginners, intermediate and
						advanced potters. I particularly enjoyed the throwing
						and assembly of a tea pot, or spouted vessel, as Tom
						calls them. You will also enjoy the slide show at the
						end of disc four showing 34 pots from his collection
						that span 1970-2004. So watch. listen, and learn from
						someone who really knows what he's doing.<br>

						Invite a highly respected potter into your classroom!!!
						Expose your students to 44 years of experience through
						viewing a Tom Turner workshop. Turner�s new DVD series
						is an engaging resource for students wishing to explore
						ceramics in-depth. The four disk DVD set documents a
						workshop where Turner shares his knowledge and

						gain insight into his artistic thought processes. Tom
						discusses and demonstrates correlation of decoration and
						design, throwing and trimming, lids, teapots, handles,
						wedging, as well as many more techniques. The last disc
						includes a portfolio showcasing Turner�s work from 1970
						� 2004. Beginning art students to seasoned art teachers
						will glean information that is simply not available any
						other way. <br>
