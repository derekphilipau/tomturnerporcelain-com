				</font></b><font color="#333333" face="Arial" size="2">I had to convey my
				appreciation of your latest incarnation of Turner�s Best
				Porcelain (Standard # 600). As soon as I started centering this
				porcelain I knew it was different from your previous
				formulations. It has a very tight feel that continues throughout
				the throwing process. I never felt like I was losing control of
				the form. I tend to throw with more water than the average
				potter and this porcelain took the excess while moving to
				wherever I directed. I was just running some preliminary tests
				and found that I didn�t want to stop throwing this body. That�s
				probably the highest compliment a potter can give to a porcelain
				and its creator. As you know, I�ve thrown pots for 26 years now
				and have used or tested upwards of 80 different stonewares and
				porcelains. I can say with confidence that this is the best
				throwing body that I�ve come across in some time and definitely
				the best porcelain period. I am in the process of studying its
				drying properties, how it takes handles, testing shrinkage at
				cone 6, and how my glazes react to this porcelain. I am
				interested in constantly improving my work so I begin with the
				best equipment, raw materials, and clay at my disposal with the
				end goal being consistency in quality. Having Standard Ceramic
				Supply mix and distribute #600 removes any concerns I would have
				regarding batch to batch quality. I�ll let you know the results
				of my further testing. I already have an educated guess that the
				cone 9 #600 will be plenty vitreous at cone 6 from testing its
				predecessors. Talk to you soon- Chris Powell, studio potter.

				</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#333333">Here we have
				another border line issue-crazing. Is it a defect, or a
				decoration? Crazing is caused by the glaze shrinking more than
				the body during cooling of the glaze firing in the kiln. Crazing
				can be seen as a flaw, especially on low fired pottery where
				liquids will go through the craze, through the body, and onto
				furniture. Crazing is also called crackle, and has been
				developed to a high art by the Oriental potters. I have said
				before, &quot;When does crazing become crackle, when you put ink in
				it&quot;. Crazing on a vitreous body such as porcelain, is not a
				flaw, or detriment. Some colors prefer the chemistry that causes
				crazing. Sometimes adjustments can be made to the glazes, or the
				bodies, but sometimes it just has to be lived with. My refires
				tend to craze more than on the first firing, but that's because
				they are getting more melt, creating much more vibrant color.
				There is also delayed crazing that happens months and years
				after the piece is fired. Here again, I would prefer not to have
				it, but I accept it for certain glazes.</font><br>
				<br>
				<b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#993333">
				<a name="Refiring"></a>Refiring</font></b><br>
				<font color="#333333">
				<font size="2">I have gotten more and more into refiring pots to really max out
				color and interesting surfaces. When I refire, I run the risk of
				loosing the piece completely, or changing it into something I
				like more than before. Sometimes I don't loose the piece, but
				there can develop what I will call &quot;ceramic acne&quot;. Pimples erupt
				from captured air in the walls that expand upon refiring into
				what we call bloats. There can be other surface blemishes as
				well. Normally we do not want any sort of &quot;ceramic acne&quot;, but
				with the refires that come out better, I accept some of these
				anomalies. There can also be discoloration of the unglazed
				porcelain and many times the glaze crazes. The first firing
				melts chemicals into a glass or glaze; the second refire remelts
				a glass or glaze. With refiring, very different reactions take
				place and the results are different from the first firing.
				Sometimes I just refire to get more melt and sometimes I will
				heat the pot in the electric kiln to about 250 degrees F and
				spray another glaze over the first glaze and then refire. If I
				accept the piece as finished, I also accept the acne that comes
				along with the process. I have read where the Japanese prefer
				and treasure such anomalies. Those of you who know my work, know
				that my standards are extremely high, maybe too high, so I ask
				that you accept my acceptance of these &quot;in the process&quot;
				anomalies. No plunge: no pearl. <br>
				<br>
				Since I was accepting these anomalies as part of the process of
				getting a greater pot, I was blind to them once accepted. A very
				good customer brought this to my attention and I will try to be
				more vigilant when I photograph them to show what I have
				accepted. I also understand that web purchases are from
				photographs and if you are not satisfied when you receive the
				piece, please contact me and I will accept a return, or
				exchange, minus the shipping costs.<br>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#333333">Each kiln is different, each load is
		different, the weather is different, and each potter�s ideas are
		different. I believe candling a kiln overnight is a waste of time and
		fuel. Universities do it because they don�t pay for the fuel and it
		makes the firing day shorter. I light a kiln and keep it under 250
		degrees the first hour and then proceed on up. &nbsp;Ten degrees per minute
		is 600 degrees per hour.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#333333">If you are firing bisqued ware,
		there is no reason after the first hour that you cannot go 300-600
		degrees per hour up to reduction. I go slow the first half hour to
		remove any water from the glazes and bisque, cone pads, etc. Industry
		fires to cone 14, up and down in 90 MINUTES. You can be at cone 05-06 in
		4 hours and start reduction. I start at cone 05 with the oxy-probe at
		.65.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#333333">Atmospheric burners-maintain clean,
		efficient combustion all the way to reduction.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#333333">Forced air burners-maintain clean
		efficient combustion without excess air.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#333333">I start reduction at cone 05, and
		only the lightest amount of reduction to get the results I want. NEVER
		is there carbon anywhere. Carbon does not reduce, carbon monoxide
		reduces. I start at .65 on my oxy-probe.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#333333">DO NOT REDUCE AIR INTO THE BURNERS!
		To start reduction, simply push the damper in until there is slight
		pressure out the bottom peephole. At first there may not be a flame out
		the bottom, but there will be pressure and if you smell it, it will take
		your breath away, (or burn your lungs if you are not careful).</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#333333">What happens is that the same amount
		of gas continues to go in, but the damper has restricted the amount of
		air going in, both primary and secondary air. More importantly, by
		reducing with the damper you create a pressure that provides a more even
		firing, and with CLEAN reduction.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#333333">Once I learn a kiln and the damper
		setting for the reduction I want, I set that and leave it alone
		throughout the firing. If you finish a kiln with the damper at 3 inches,
		then start the kiln with the damper at 4 inches. We were taught to
		grossly over-reduce because our teachers really didn�t know any better.&nbsp;
		In the 60�s everyone was learning. So they would over reduce and loose
		temperature, then oxidize to get temperature up again, then over reduce,
		and so on. I think this procedure also echoed earlier firings with wood
		where you stoke and get reduction, it burns neutral and oxidation, then
		you stoke again, etc. When potters over reduced they would always �clean
		up the kiln� at the end; but my point is if you don�t over reduce, there
		is no need to clean anything up. Now, oxidation at the end is not bad,
		just don�t over reduce so that it is necessary.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#333333">Without an oxyprobe we judge
		reduction by how much flame comes out the peep holes and the character
		and color of that flame. IDEAL reduction is greenish purple that is
		clean and steady pressure of about 6 to 8 inches of flame out the top
		peep hole. I highly recommend an oxyprobe! They will pay for themselves
		in no time. You will save fuel, time, and firings will be consistent.
		The oxyprobes vary and we can�t be specific on numbers. The directions
		call for milder reduction than we usually want, and without enough
		pressure, you will not get an even firing and even reduction. Many
		potters start reduction at .7 on the oxyprobe. If you have very clean
		reduction and sufficient pressure, I think you could start at maybe .6.&nbsp;
		All of this is trial and error and once you get the gas and damper
		settings that work for you, you use those numbers as a guide for
		successive firings, realizing each firing will be different do to
		loading, weather, etc. Potter�s using natural gas will have slightly
		different settings and results as compared to those using propane.&nbsp;
		Point is, once you get YOUR settings, all you have to do is go there
		next time. The oxyprobe will show a different reduction reading if you
		move the damper ONLY the width of a pencil line. In my Ohio studio, if
		you opened the front door, reduction began to drop and you could see it
		on the probe. Likewise when you open a peephole, the numbers start to
		drop. The peep hole becomes more chimney, allowing more air into the
		kiln. Realize that the chimney pulls air from ANY opening, ANYWHERE in
		the kiln. It draws from the opening above the damper, it draws from the
		burner ports, and it draws from ANY crack ANYWHERE in the kiln or
		chimney. Holes in the chimney are passive dampers.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#333333">So back to firing- once the proper
		amount of reduction is set, I do not change it. As the kiln gets hotter,
		it will burn off some of the reduction and the numbers will lower and
		the flame get even cleaner. When my desired cone has fallen, I turn the
		kiln off and close the damper. End of firing and leave it overnight.</font></p>

My friend Terry is firing your porcelain to cone 11 in a crystalline firing with
no problems. He has built a very impressive electric reduction kiln which
automatically reduces and a solenoid and oxy probe adjust the amount of
reduction.<br>
I have begun to institute a hold of 45 minutes at 800C/1472F and it appears to
be very promising in stopping bloating -this is a new experiment and I have only
done 2 firings but neither pot bloated and they were the ones that were
bloating. This may be the key -- just some volatiles that need to come out of
the clay.<br>

			<br>
			I <font color="#333333" size="2">have been receiving phone calls and emails about problems with
			porcelain and it is time to discuss this so these errors can be
			eliminated. I have done high fired porcelain pottery for over 40
			years and have experienced many of the problems people are having
			today. I must say that part of the problem today is that many people
			learn to make pots without any technical training to go along with
			the mechanical training of learning to center and throw. Then they
			buy someone else�s porcelain, misuse it, and then want to blame the
			porcelain. This is unfair to themselves and to those of us who
			provide porcelain for them to use.<br>
			<br>
			Porcelain is not clay, it is porcelain. Porcelain is man made and
			formulated for the manufacturing process and firing temperature
			required to do the job. I have seen porcelains from cone 01 to cone
			14 which were formulated for a specific use. Naturally a slip
			casting porcelain will be different from a throwing porcelain in the
			type of materials chosen for each body. I am a potter who loves to
			throw pots and my porcelain was formulated by me, for me, to throw
			as well as possible while staying very white and firing to total
			maturity, or vitrification. It throws incredibly well, is very
			white, and as a bonus is translucent. I can throw 5 pound pots
			totally translucent. Many commercially available porcelains have a
			leeway of several cones to satisfy many customers and to cover
			mistakes and over firing. As a result people have been led to
			believe that all manufactured bodies can be over fired 2 or 3 cones
			and should survive. This is not being realistic. My porcelain is
			sold as cone 9 because it is totally done at cone 9, as are my
			glazes. If you choose to fire over cone 9, you are on your own as I
			only recommend cone 9. I do know that Otto Heino in California is
			firing it to cone 12 in a wood kiln, but that�s because Otto
			understands the mechanics of porcelain. If porcelain pots are not
			thrown correctly, trimmed correctly, dried correctly, and fired
			correctly, you will have problems. If you want to side fire them
			with other pots on top, naturally they are going to warp. If you
			don�t design, throw and trim properly, naturally they are going to
			warp, especially when you over fire them 2 or 3 cones.<br>
			<br>
			Since we are talking about a body that is vitreous and soft like
			taffy in the firing, we must learn to design properly. Feet MUST be
			directly below the walls to support the form while it is soft in the
			kiln, or you will have warping. There cannot be thin spots from
			trimming too far or you will have warping or collapse. I have always
			said that I believed porcelain was as soft in the firing as it is on
			the wheel. You cannot cantilever forms out beyond the foot as easily
			as you might with an under-fired body. If you want to do these
			things then I suggest under fired porcelain, or don�t use porcelain
			at all. An under fired porcelain won�t be vitreous or ring like a
			bell, which for me is part of the aesthetics of porcelain, the
			sounds it makes. Lids that are ground in place have a sensuous soft
			sound; and a tight vitreous porcelain rings like a bell when struck
			with a knuckle or small object. For me, that is all part of why I
			work with porcelain.<br>
			<br>
			Now because this vitreous porcelain is soft like taffy in the kiln,
			naturally lids are going to want to stick to lips and feet are going
			to want to stick to unwashed shelves, or poorly wash shelves. Think
			of porcelain as molten glass, which it is in a way, and these events
			make sense. The easy solution is to put alumina hydrate in your wax
			resist at about a teaspoon of hydrate to a cup of wax. I use Alcoa
			c-33 which I guess to be about 150 mesh and coarser than what you
			would put into a glaze. I also use this in my kiln wash in a mixture
			of 6 parts alumina hydrate to 1 part kaolin and I spray this on my
			kiln shelves. The hi alumina wash resists the fusing action of the
			melting porcelain and the coarse particles of alumina act as little
			ball bearings to allow the foot to shrink and move during the
			firing. This wash adheres to the shelf until you take it off with a
			c-cup wire brush attached to a 90 degree body grinder. I clean my
			shelves in less than 60 seconds. A simple wire brush would do the
			same thing, just take longer.<br>
			<br>
			There have been issues with potters using my porcelain with soluble
			zinc crystalline glazes and I would like to address that too. My
			friend John Tilton has found that he has to use a porcelain that is
			under fired at cone 9 or 10 to eliminate bloating. He basically took
			my porcelain and had it mixed to fire higher and it�s working for
			him. He feels this bloating is from the solubles in the glaze
			entering the bisque surface and then reacting with the vitreous
			porcelain in the high fire. Frits today are soluble to some extent.
			John also found that he had to vent his electric kiln during bisque
			firing, or the bloating was worse. We think our new electric kilns
			are tighter than ever before and unless vented, actually fire in a
			neutral atmosphere and can in fact reduce. The vent systems that
			draw air through the lid and exhaust out the bottom seemed to work
			well.<br>
			<br>
			Let me talk more about bisque firing porcelain. When we read books
			we must put everything into perspective, or we mislead ourselves.
			Books talk about long and high bisques and that applies to clays
			that have organic material that needs to burn out in the bisque
			firing. There are practically no organics in porcelain that need
			burning out, but I do recommend a good vent drawing air through your
			kiln to ensure a clean bisque as well as to lengthen the life of
			your elements. I bisque my porcelain in 6 hours and never have
			bloating problems. We bisque fire to eliminate chemical water,
			provide some of the shrinkage, and to strengthen the pot so we can
			physically handle the piece for glazing. We still want the piece to
			be absorbent enough for the glaze to adhere, but not vitreous enough
			that the glaze takes a long time to dry. Long drying times promotes
			crawling. Therefore you need only bisque high enough to satisfy
			these needs and if you can do that at a lower temperature than
			previously experienced-why not? My porcelain starts to sinter
			earlier than other bodies and I found that cone 010 to 012 is plenty
			of heat to do all those things just mentioned. This is especially
			necessary if you throw very thin and there is not a lot of wall
			thickness to absorb the glaze. I actually glaze the interiors and
			let them dry overnight before glazing the exteriors so the walls
			don�t get over saturated with water, delay drying, and promote
			crawling. Stop and think for a minute. A shorter firing to a lower
			temperature is saving you TIME and MONEY; so what is the problem? If
			you want to bisque at cone 08 or cone 06 and you like the result,
			then you have no problem. When books or people suggest bisqueing at
			cone 02, they are referring to cone 14 porcelain. Once again, find
			out what works for you and simply do it.<br>
			<br>
			Another issue is the cost of a body as compared to other available
			bodies. If a porcelain throws better for you, is whiter, is
			translucent, and eliminates some of the problems associated with
			porcelain, isn�t that worth a few pennies? Kent McLaughlin of
			Penland recently told me that he has reduced his losses so much by
			using my porcelain that the extra cost isn�t even a factor. I ask
			people how much they get for a one pound mug and what does .16 cents
			more per pound mean. (I might add that I am seeing $30. to $45.
			mugs). Even if you get $18. for a mug, what does .16 a pound mean,
			nothing in my book. The least expense of being a fulltime potter is
			the cost of our materials. The reason my porcelain costs more is
			because the materials cost more. The kaolin I use is four steps
			better than Grolleg. It is cleaner, smoother and more plastic. I do
			not make a penny by providing my porcelain to others, and I am sure
			Standard Ceramics makes no more percentage wise than on any other
			porcelain. The difference in cost is the difference in the cost of
			materials used. So for now I would like to suggest that you realize
			that porcelain is a very different animal than clay is and that to
			be successful I suggest you baby it a little and learn to work with
			it, NOT AGAINST IT. Learn it�s characteristics and then design
			within the limitations of the material and processes you have chosen
			to use. Porcelain has always been the most challenging body to use
			and that�s why it has throughout history been very special. When it
			was first made in Europe it was more valuable than gold and was used
			as money. A great read is the book, &quot;The Arcanum: The Extraordinary
		True Story&quot;, by Janet Gleason,&nbsp; which
			documents the search and development of porcelain in Europe. Don�t
			blame the porcelain, blame yourself, or better yet, formulate your
			own porcelain.</font><br>
