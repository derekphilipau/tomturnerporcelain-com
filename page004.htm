									bank account, you�ve no doubt struggled with
									the concept of trying to be both creative
									and financially successful. According to Tom
									Turner and his wife, Gail Russell, co-owners
									of Peachblow Pottery in Lewis Center, Ohio,
									balancing art and business is a challenge
									shared by just about every potter. And they
									should know�between the two of them, they
									have over 70 years of experience making and
									selling pottery. Both have their master of
									fine arts degrees and are highly acclaimed
									in the world of contemporary art pottery.
									Their work is featured in many books written
									in the U.S., Canada, England, Spain and
									Taiwan, and their pots are in public and
									private collections throughout the U.S.,
									including the Smithsonian Institution.
									</font>

									<small><font color="#000080">According to
									Turner, finding the right balance between
									work and art varies for each individual.
									�It�s really just the nature of the business
									that everyone has to learn his or her own
									way,� he says. </font>
									<p><font color="#000080">But, he adds,
									education�both for the potter and
									consumer�often plays a key role in achieving
									success. �My advice to anyone else in this
									business is that they need all the training
									they can possibly get�a BFA, an MFA, and if
									they can get some business classes that
									would also help,� he says. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">�They should also
									talk to as many people as possible who are
									in the business,� Russell adds. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">Both Turner and
									Russell began their careers with an
									extensive education. Turner received his
									undergraduate degree in art from Illinois
									State University in 1968, and earned his
									master of fine arts degree from Clemson
									University in 1973. Russell earned her
									bachelor of fine arts degree from the
									University of Evansville in 1976, and her
									master of fine arts degree from the
									University of Illinois in 1981. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">But their education
									wasn�t limited to their classrooms�both
									Turner and Russell independently studied
									other pottery that they admired. Russell
									spent a year traveling throughout Western
									Europe and studying British potters, and
									also spent some time working in Mayan Indian
									villages in Mexico, near the pottery center
									of Ticul, while Turner studied and collected
									19th century pots and spent time with a
									number of southeastern folk potters. Many of
									these influences can be seen in their
									pottery. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">Turner and Russell
									have also spent a great deal of time sharing
									their knowledge and experience with students
									and other potters. Turner established a
									ceramic art program for the College of
									Architecture at Clemson University in 1971,
									and since then has taught at leading craft
									schools throughout the U.S., including
									Penland, Arrowmont and The Archie Bray
									Foundation. He has also taught over 125
									workshops. Russell taught ceramics at the
									University of Illinois as a graduate
									student, and also taught at the University
									of Evansville and the Delaware County
									Cultural Arts Center. According to Turner,
									the couple is frequently asked by local
									colleges and artists to teach classes, but
									they don�t have the space. They do, however,
									often host tours of their studio, with
									in-depth explanations of their processes, as
									well as demonstrations. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">But it isn�t just
									the potter or would-be potter who needs to
									be educated�it�s also the consumer. And
									according to Turner, today�s universities
									aren�t doing an adequate job of making
									people appreciate handmade pottery.
									�Universities pretty much quit teaching the
									art of the potter a number of years ago. As
									a result, they also quit educating buyers.
									Many of our buyers have tried to make
									pottery, so they appreciate the feet and
									form, and the lips and glazes, but we�re
									seeing less of that because many of the
									universities have switched to sculpture
									instead. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">�The best pots that
									I can make, I want them to stand the test of
									time. I don�t want them to be valuable just
									in 2002� I want them to be good in 100
									years. And I want the people who buy my pots
									to appreciate that level of quality,� he
									says. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">Although both
									Turner and Russell would like to see
									universities integrate more pottery into
									their programs, they have noticed that in
									many cases, local art centers are stepping
									in to fill the void. �We�ve been seeing a
									lot more art centers cropping up, and in
									every art center that we know about, the
									clay classes pretty much keep them in
									business. They�re all very full, and that�s
									great news,� Russell says. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">Additionally,
									first-time buyers of high-quality pottery
									often come to appreciate handmade pottery
									simply through visiting Peachblow Pottery�s
									studio. �Often we�ll get new customers who
									might not be used to buying a high-quality
									handmade piece for a little more money, so
									they might start out with something small.
									But over the years, as they visit us and
									learn to appreciate what we�re doing, they
									kind of step up little by little and begin
									buying larger pieces or a more special or
									one-of-a-kind pieces. It�s nice to see that
									happen,� Russell says</font>.<br>

									<small><font color="#000080">Of course,
									having an educated customer is just one
									aspect of making sure your pottery sells.
									According to Turner and Russell, you also
									need to make sure that consumers know about
									your pottery�and that you�re making products
									consumers want to buy. </font>
									<p><font color="#000080">In many cases,
									Turner says, where you live determines what
									types of products you�ll be able to sell.
									�We sell coffee mugs all the way up to large
									pieces, ranging from $10 to $600 each. And I
									think that�s relative to this market. We
									chose to live here, and these are the types
									of pieces that the local people are looking
									for. If I just wanted to make all $600
									pieces, I wouldn�t sell enough. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">�Our products might
									sell better in Los Angeles, New York or
									Chicago, but we don�t want to live there. So
									we have to deal with that,� Turner adds.
									</font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">Potters who want
									exposure to markets in other cities can
									develop relationships with galleries and
									attend art shows, and both Turner and
									Russell have had a great deal of experience
									with those venues. But difficulties with
									these arrangements include packaging and
									shipping the products and having to split
									the profits with the gallery or show host.
									</font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">For that reason,
									the couple decided to begin retailing all of
									their products from their own shop when they
									moved to Lewis Center in 1986. According to
									Turner, the shop is open just about every
									day of the week, whenever one of them is
									home. �It�s evolved to where we�re now
									selling the majority of our pots here, and
									we want more of that,� Turner says. �If we
									can sell all the pots we can make here, then
									there�s no reason to go to the shows or ship
									to the galleries. It�s really more enjoyable
									to sell out of our own gallery.� </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">�Generally, there
									are also more pieces to choose from,�
									Russell adds. �And most people like to come
									and see how and where the pieces are made.�
									</font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">�People want to see
									what we�re all about,� Turner says. �They
									see our home, they see the studio and our
									gardens. Gail keeps bees and I�ve got a
									little wine vineyard. They buy a total
									package. We sometimes say that they buy a
									piece of us when they buy one of our pots,
									and seeing where we live adds to that,�
									Turner says. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">But with the added
									convenience and pleasure of selling from
									their studio has come a greater need for the
									couple to market themselves. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">�We don�t get a lot
									of walk-in traffic, so we have to encourage
									people to come here,� Turner says. �We have
									open houses twice a year where we send out a
									direct mail invitation to around 1800 people
									on a mailing list that we�ve compiled over
									the last 15 years during other open houses.
									Additionally, Gail has continued doing local
									shows, which also brings more people to our
									studio. We are also investigating a little
									bit more advertising to get more people
									coming here.� </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">Their marketing
									efforts have been successful�the couple
									sells almost every piece they make,
									averaging around 1000 to 1200 pieces per
									year each, and most of the pieces are
									purchased from their own gallery. But like
									everything else, marketing remains a
									constant challenge. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">�Making pots is the
									joy�we love it. Marketing is the difficult
									part of the business. We�ve survived all
									these years, so it�s not that we�re not
									doing it right. It just hasn�t gotten
									easier,� Turner says.<br>

									<small><font color="#000080">Perhaps the
									most challenging aspect of running a pottery
									business is finding the time to tackle all
									of the various tasks that need to be
									accomplished. On Turner�s business card, his
									title reads, �owner, president, vice
									president, secretary, treasurer, shipping
									and receiving, and janitor��a humorous but
									truthful statement that captures the busy
									lives both he and Russell lead. </font>
									<p><font color="#000080">�It�s hard to find
									time to get concentrated work done, even
									though we�re here seven days a week, 24
									hours a day. Having to wear all those
									different hats makes things difficult,�
									Turner says. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">�People think we
									just sit at the wheel, but we probably don�t
									work at the wheel 10% of the time. There are
									business issues, and then in the process
									itself there are so many steps�it�s not just
									being at the wheel. There�s the office side
									of it�letters, slides, phone calls, e-mails,
									packing and shipping. And then there�s the
									marketing aspect. We�d like to start tapping
									into the Internet to sell some of our pots,
									for instance, but that�s just another job to
									add to the limited time we have available.
									</font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">�Additionally, the
									pots control you,� Turner adds. �If you have
									pots to trim, you have to be there to trim
									them. You might work Saturday and Sunday and
									then take Monday off to run errands. There�s
									a tremendous freedom and flexibility, but
									you�re also chained at times. There are a
									lot of dichotomies here, yin and yang.�
									</font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">Given all of the
									challenges, it�s easy to see why pottery is
									becoming somewhat of a lost art. Making a
									living as an artist is almost an oxymoron.
									How can you fulfill your own creative
									passions while trying to sell to customers
									who may not appreciate your art? How do you
									find time to improve your artistic abilities
									while earning enough money to pay the bills?
									And why would anyone want to put themselves
									through the day-to-day struggles of the
									pottery business when they could just as
									easily find another career? </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">Perhaps it is
									because the benefits far outweigh the
									difficulties. There are the joys of being
									your own boss and setting your own schedule,
									and the pleasures of creating art and
									influencing future generations. And there is
									the satisfaction of knowing that you are
									living your dream. </font></p>
									<p><font color="#000080">&quot;We are driven to
									be potters�we love the process and it�s
									truly a labor of love,&quot; says Turner. </font>
									</p>
									<p><font color="#000080">�We have the best
									of all worlds,� he adds. �It�s not easy, but
									it�s as wonderful as it is frustrating.�</font><br>
