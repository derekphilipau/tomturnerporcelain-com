				<a name="Yasim Richmond">Tom....thank you so much for the three
				amazingly educational days that I spent at the workshop you
				offered Bill and myself. Your knowledge of the art and
				craftsmanship of pottery is astonishing. But what was so obvious
				is what an excellent teacher you are. You took the time to
				demonstrate and then to observe closely what I was doing and
				able to tell and show me what I could do to improve my work. I
				have not had the privilege of having such observed and detailed
				feedback on my work. I learned about so many of the aspects of
				pottery - from throwing, trimming, developing and changing
				glazes to suit ones own work and firing not to mention
				aesthetics and form for which you have a talent and passion.
				Thank you for your patience and time. Also, the collection that
				you have acquired over the years served as an excellent teaching
				tool along with your comments on the pots, the age of the
				creation of the work and all the other details about the history
				of pottery that you provided. I loved working with your
				porcelain. I am looking forward to receiving my order of your
				porcelain from Standard. I hope you will take the time to make
				more videos and write about the many and varied aspects of
				pottery and porcelain in particular so that others can benefit
				from your knowledge, experience and years of hard work. Again,
				thank you for such a growth providing experience. Yasmin
				Richmond. </a><br><br>Thank you for sharing your
				extraordinary experience and knowledge with me for the three
				days in beautiful autumn Mars Hill. It was good timing for my
				skill level as I was able to appreciate the subtleties of form
				and decoration we discussed at length. Our little pot made it
				home safely and I will keep it in my studio for reference and
				inspiration. Thanks also for the tour of your vast collection.
				Staggering. I look forward to digging into your porcelain in the
				near future. <br>Again, thank you for the instruction and for
				sharing your studio with me. I got settled in at home after your
				workshop and finally got to work with your porcelain. It is
				luscious. Period. I pulled a fairly narrow 4 pound bowl based
				cylinder and kept widening and widening, sure it was headed for
				a collapse. It didn't. What fun!<br>Maggie Anderson<br><br><br>Last month I took a trip to
				North Carolina for the opportunity to study at Tom Turner�s
				studio in Mars Hill. We spent three days talking pots and
				studying his extensive museum caliber collection, as well as
				playing with his amazing porcelain. Tom is a masterful teacher
				with a collector�s vast knowledge of pots and their makers. He
				challenged us to question our sources and allow our personality
				and spirit to add depth and individuality to our pots. He pushed
				us to know our intent each time we sat at the wheel, and to seek
				the finest level of detail and finish on each aspect of making.
				His technical expertise, knowledge and skill in working with
				porcelain were top-notch. He left us inspired, wiser for our
				time with him, and with much to ponder. Holly McKeen,

				<font color="#333333"><a name="Bill Schran"></a>Thanks again for a great learning
				experience!<br>
				I hope it was a good learning experience for you also.<br>
				<br>
				Your ability to patiently work with a variety of skill levels
				and address<br>
				the needs of each student on an individual basis speaks well of
				you and<br>
				reflects you previous teaching experience.<br>
				<br>
				Having the opportunity to view and examine close up your vast
				collection of<br>
				pottery was almost worth the price of the workshop itself. The
				ability to<br>
				see examples of what you are discussing at any given time is
				perhaps the<br>
				best reinforcement for the student.<br>
				<br>
				I highly recommend the entire experience.<br>
				It's certainly not your typical workshop.<br>
				The individual attention, the masterful demonstrations, Tom's
				museum of<br>
				pottery, his porcelain and the motivation to achieve all add up
				to an<br>
				experience that should not be missed.<br>

				<p><font color="#333333"><a name="Katrina Thiebaut"></a>Dear Tom,<br>
				I had the pleasure of spending three days with you in April,
				2009. I enjoyed the information sharing immensely. It is hard to
				put into words exactly what the three days of demonstrations,
				hands-on learning, and unending answered questions means to me.
				As you know, I am just starting out with ceramics at the age of
				51 and feel the need to learn from the most knowledgeable and in
				the most efficient way possible. Having the undivided attention
				of someone that has spent so many years perfecting his craft was
				priceless. I gained a wealth of information, and I feel very
				&quot;centered&quot; in my goals and objectives for myself in this field
				of study. <br>
				You are someone that my 80year old mother would describe as
				&quot;down to earth.&quot; It is true that the teachers who are the most
				confident in their own field are the ones who exchange
				information to eager learners with ease and respect. No question
				of mine was considered unworthy of your time. Your &quot;attention to
				detail&quot; goes way beyond your ceramics expertise. You paid close
				attention to my current level of abilities and understanding of
				the process and adjusted every aspect of your teaching to meet
				my individual needs. For a student to get just what they need at
				the point they need it is, in my opinion, attention to detail at
				its finest! <br>
				I would recommend your individualized classes to anyone at any
				level of learning. Even as a beginner, I can easily recognize
				your master skill. The large collection of pottery that you have
				gathered over the years and your knowledge of the different
				potters and time periods are astounding. You hold in your mind
				and inside your studio so much to share with those willing to
				accept your gracious teaching. Thank you for the awesome
				experience.<br>
				Sincerely, <br>
				Katrina Thiebaut<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p><font color="#333333">With the combination of the instruction and the porcelain, I
				was able to throw higher and better than I ever have. Not only
				did my hands get better, but my eye for pottery also got better
				thanks to your knowledge and library of pots. Thanks for making
				me a better potter. <br>
				Dan Hester</font></p>
				<p><font color="#333333">
				I attended a 3
				day workshop with Tom after hearing from numerous potters that
				the experience would be well worth it. I went into it hoping to
				learn a few new tricks to improve my throwing, and hoping to
				remedy a few bad habits that I knew I had fallen into, but
				couldn�t seem to shake. What I got out of the workshop was much
				more than I had hoped for. Not only did he give me some great
				coaching that helped me to remedy the areas that I knew I was
				weak, but he helped me to identify and correct more subtle
				problems as well. <br>
				<br>
				An unexpected bonus that I got out of my workshop was the fact
				that Tom got me to slow down. As a working mother, I try to be
				as efficient as possible at pretty much everything I do, and
				this philosophy was spilling over into my pottery. Tom helped me
				to remember that for me, pottery is a time to relax and really
				enjoy myself � to �walk behind the turtle� as he says. I�ll be
				honest, slowing down was not an easy thing for me, but since I
				have, I�ve found a new peace and calm when I throw that I had
				lost along the line. <br>
				<br>
				Since my workshop, I am making nicer shapes with lovely thin
				walls, and having far fewer failures. Most importantly, though,
				I am enjoying pottery much more now than I was before. Because
				of what I had heard about Tom, I had high expectations of him,
				and he gave me far more than I had anticipated! I have no
				trouble at all recommending this workshop � you won�t be
				disappointed! <br>

				<font color="#333333">My name is Mike Oliver, I�m the studio
				manager at the Sioux City Art Center clay studio and I�d like to
				tell you about my visit to Tom Turner�s studio for three days of
				lessons this past January. I went there hoping to improve my
				throwing skills and maybe learn a little bit about glazing that
				would help me do the studio manager job a little better.<br>
				<br>
				I got a lot more than I had hoped for. I spent about half my
				time there practicing throwing with Tom looking over my
				shoulder. If it sounds a little intimidating to throw with a
				master observing, it�s not. Tom is a teacher, not a critic, and
				he is a very good teacher. If you don�t get what he�s trying to
				tell you, he�ll find another way to put it until you do. He�s
				very patient and really wants to help you improve. From throwing
				to trimming to structure to just different ways to think about
				what you�re doing, Tom shares with you from a huge wealth of
				knowledge and experience. <br>
				<br>
				I�ve had a chance to come home and put what I learned into
				practice and my pots are night to day better than they were. I
				learned tips about glazing and ways to adjust glazes that have
				me looking forward to opening every kiln I fire. Several glazes
				we had problems with are no longer problems. <br>
				<br>
				I also got a special bonus. Tom loves what he does and I came
				home more excited about working in clay than I had been anytime
				since I took my first clay class in college in 1972. It�s been
				four months now and I�m still excited.<br>
				<br>
				Once I get everything I learned worked into what I do, I�ll
				probably want to go back and take Tom�s class again. I have no
				doubt that I could take his class half a dozen times and make a
				big jump forward every time. Besides, I had a lot of fun while I
				was there.<br>
				<br>
				If you enjoy making pots, give yourself a great gift and go take
				a class from Tom.<br>

				After several years of working
				outside the clay world, I currently have the opportunity to
				return to studio ceramics. My interest in porcelain directed me
				to the work of Tom Turner. In hopes of accelerating my learning
				curve, I signed up for Tom�s three day workshop at his studio in
				Mars Hill, NC. A truly beautiful location in the hills north of
				Asheville. <br>
				<br>
				One immediately encounters Tom�s amazing collection of
				Contemporary, Traditional American folk pottery, and Asian
				ceramics. His passion for collecting is enhanced by his
				forty-seven years of experience in clay. Tom�s vast web of
				knowledge overlaps with personal connections with luminaries
				such as Otto and Vivika Heino, Ralph Bacerra, Tatsuzo Shimaoka,
				Dave Shaner, and Don Reitz, just to name a few. Tom�s elegant
				forms with their outstanding glazed surfaces are also available
				to examine. <br>
				<br>
				The studio sessions with Tom covered all aspects of the ceramic
				process from throwing and altering forms, to making lids, spouts
				and handles, as well as discussions on glazing, testing and
				firing. Areas of personal interest were investigated in depth.
				Examples from the collection aided in further dialogs in regards
				to aesthetics. Tom's specially developed porcelain clay body was
				responsive and devoid of typical porcelain challenges such as
				slumping. The porcelain was quite enjoyable to work with and
				effortless to throw. <br>
				<br>
				North Carolina�s rich tradition of ceramics continues to thrive
				throughout the state. I�m most grateful for the suggested
				artists, potteries, galleries and museums to visit while I was
				in the area. This experience has certainly strengthened my
				skills, but more importantly opened up many new arenas to
				investigate for future inspiration. <br>

				Last night I returned from Tom Turner's for some one on one
				instruction over the last 3 days. It's truly amazing what bad
				habits can be formed and not seen until you're sitting in front
				of a 45+ year potter. After overcoming those obstacles, a whole
				new light was shed on attention to detail and aesthetics. He
				just does it naturally without thinking and it makes such a
				difference in his pots. I was becoming bored with my pots and
				have to assume my customers were as well. If nothing more, I
				became very motivated while there. I went to the studio this
				morning and spent the entire day analyzing my small tools,
				stamps, glazes and processes deciding what to keep and what
				needs a change. Tom is a great source of knowledge in all
				aspects of the ceramic industry. One thing I liked was when I
				walked in each morning; Tom would ask me what I wanted to do.
				He's there to teach you what <i>YOU</i> want to learn. I chose
				to spend much of my time just talking with him. The history and
				stories are worth it all. Speaking of history, Tom has a
				collection of pottery that everyone should see as it's truly
				amazing. His studio is up on a mountain and is so serene and
				peaceful that the only thing we heard were locusts. If you have
				the chance or desire to visit with Tom, I highly recommend you
				do. I'm hoping to utilize what I have learned and hopefully make
				another trip back in the fall or next spring.<br>

				TT,<br>
				<br>
				My studio is now divided into BT pots and AT pots, that's Before
				Turner and After Turner. A huge difference. I took most of my BT
				unfired pots and threw them in recycle. After my days with you
				they aren't worth firing. The BT bisque pots will be used for
				glaze testing and line blends. <br>
				I loved your glaze room and all the test tiles.I am delighted
				that the glaze firing I witnessed turned out so well. I learned
				a lot because the oxyprobe readings were questionable so you
				relied on the look of the flames and the smells coming from the
				peeps.My thrown cylinders are getting better, and ribbing them
				out to fuller shapes with even walls is progressing nicely.
				Throwing in series as a design and learning tool is proving to
				be very enlightening. I am spending more time in the studio
				(with my business phone close at hand) and less time in the
				office - series throwing is that addictive.<br>
				Your porcelain continues to perform beautifully, even as
				recycle.<br>
				<br>
				The poster you signed is now hung at the Corcoran School of Art
				and Design. It looks great and the signature is drawing
				additional attention.Thanks again for boosting my aspirations in
				porcelain by a quantum amount. I had a wonderful time. <br>

				<p><font color="#333333"><a name="Claudia"></a>Good Morning Tom!<br>
				<br>
				I've had a couple of weeks for my mind to absorb the information
				I learned in your workshop. Since the workshop I've had time to
				work on my own and watch my mindset changing. And believe me, at
				this stage of life with 30 years of throwing pots, change ain't
				easy. I have bad habits, but I realize that I have some pretty
				good ones, too. As you say, I'm a better potter than my pots
				show. <br>
				From wedging, to throwing, to finishing, there are even minute
				changes I've made that allow me to make more distinctive pots.
				Or, as you say, pots with &quot;intention&quot;. Intention indicates
				thinking, planning, and aesthetic awareness. Your vast eclectic
				collection of pottery was integral to the study of the anatomy
				of pots. Having those fabulous examples of work, including your
				own, was truly instructive in helping me better understand
				structures from rims to lids to handles, to the relationship of
				all these parts. Sometimes after throwing pots for a long time
				it can be difficult to see the forest for the trees, i.e. the
				relationship of the foot to the rim, the handle to the mug, or
				the lid to the shoulder of the jar. <br>
				The best way to pull oneself out of the ruts of habitual and
				complacent work is to have an objective, accomplished, and
				forthright perspective for guidance. Our discussions on form and
				the function of pots as well as working with the porcelain
				renewed my perspective and provided new challenges. Even though
				the instruction was specific to porcelain, I have gained skills
				that I can apply to any clay body. I look forward to developing
				and fine tuning my work.<br>
				<br>
				And, Thank you, Tom!<br>

				<td valign="top"><font color="#333333"><a name="Gina Mars"></a>Hi Tom,</font><p>
				<font color="#333333">As a potter for 18 yrs I recently decided to think about
				changing from a raku/stoneware potter to a porcelain potter. I
				had always been
				a huge fan of Tom Turner and decided to visit his Mars Hill NC
				studio/school. Tom charges his students a modest fee for 2 full
				days of whatever you want to do. Talk, make pots ect. I was
				lucky enough to catch him when he was firing his geil kiln
				porcelain with copper reds/flambe. It was an incredible
				experience. I feel you can always use a new perspective
				and learn something new even if you have years of experience.
				Tom has 45 years experience and his work is incredible. He
				has so many incredible potter friends and stories that I could
				have stayed much longer and learned something new everyday.<br>
				You know a potter still has his spark when he wakes up at the
				crack of dawn to peak inside the kiln when it is hot. I would
				recommend Tom's school to any beginner or advanced potter who
				doesn't have a lot of time or money
				I really felt it was worth every penny. One night Tom took me
				out to see the surrounding towns that are full of galleries and
				college students. His place is 30 minutes from Penland.
				Apparently there are 150 potters in the area. When Tom runs into
				college students he usually invites them to visit his studio
				which I thought was an amazing offer. The college kids reply was
				something like. &quot;Thanks, but I have lots of potter friends.&quot;
				This I found amazing because living in New York is totally
				different. If I mention that I am a potter, people usually look
				at me like I have two heads. What's a potter? You mean you smoke
				pot? Of coarse I find this equally irritating as Tom must find
				these student potters in NC. If Tom approached me with an invite
				I would certainly take it. I will never forget waking up early
				and removing one of those
				red pots from the kiln and holding it close for warmth in the
				morning chill. What an experience.<br>

				<font color="#333333">It was an
				incredible experience to spend two days with you in your
				beautiful mountaintop home and studio. Your generosity and
				hospitality made my husband and I feel comfortable and exceeded
				every expectation we had for the class and trip to North
				Carolina. The wonderful dinner and trip to Penland for the
				opening were certainly beyond anything we imagined and were so
				much appreciated. The time we spent with you went by so quickly
				yet was packed with so much information and great experiences,
				that it will take some time to absorb it all.<br>
				<br>
				I feel very fortunate to have been able to take this class with
				you individually and to have been able to use the time we had to
				view your remarkable collection and slides. I greatly
				appreciated the critique of my work and suggestions for
				improvement. The history, and meaningful discussions, along with
				observing you throw and finish your work was an extraordinary
				experience. It was an amazing opportunity to watch a master at
				work and to be able to see the nuances in the level of detail
				and maturity in your work. I'm so glad that you were willing to
				sit and throw all afternoon on Friday so I could closely observe
				your techniques and how much further you take each piece than I
				do. It gives me something to strive for in my own pottery with
				new insight and vision. I'm anxious to get back to my studio
				this week and begin that process.<br>
				<br>
				I would highly recommend your class to fellow potters, and hope
				to come back again in the future.</font><p>
				<font color="#333333">I finally got back into the studio yesterday and had
				a great day applying the techniques I learned during our class.
				I was able to throw larger fuller forms than I ever have in the
				past. The throwing techniques such as opening wider, starting
				with the donut shape, and expanding the shoulder then bringing
				the lower portion out to meet it were amazingly helpful in
				expanding my forms. Starting with the wider foot and bringing it
				in as I did each successive pull really helped to stabilize the
				larger form, and I still ended up with the narrow foot that I
				like. I also threw lids using the techniques you demonstrated. I
				am so glad you demonstrated as much as you did on the second day
				of class. I learned so much by watching you work, and the photos
				helped me remember the techniques and detail.<br>

				<p>&nbsp;<p><font color="#333333">I was looking for a diversion and a
				reason to get out of Los Angeles; something fun, a new place to
				explore, a possible new place to live with an added educational
				bonus. My vacations are usually scheduled around workshops and
				classes so an opportunity to study with a master porcelain
				potter seemed perfect. I am a potter and sculptor but haven�t
				had much experience with porcelain. <br>
				<br>
				The time I spent with Tom Turner was fabulous beyond my wildest
				dreams. My private lessons focused on the areas where I needed
				the most help and I was able to learn about anything I wanted.
				Our discussions about form and design produced many �Aha!�
				moments. I saw the interrelationships of the diameters and lines
				of a pot in new and different ways. I tried to absorb every bit
				of information I could, watching and taking pictures of Tom
				throwing for hours, trimming, making lids and handles. I
				probably drove him a little crazy with my camera clicking almost
				480 photos in only 2 days. <br>
				<br>
				His huge museum quality collection of ancient and 19th and 20th
				century pottery is beautiful and inspirational and the slide
				shows were remarkable and wonderful to see. Tom put so much of
				his energy and heart into this workshop and I appreciate all of
				his efforts and boundless hospitality. <br>
				<br>
				During the six days I was in the area, we drove out to a
				friend�s house to see the huge wood-fired kiln containing three
				months of work, there was a yummy potluck dinner and Tom baked a
				delicious apple cream pie from scratch. On another day we had a
				wonderful dinner at an eclectically decorated and colorful Greek
				restaurant in Weaverville, we went gallery hopping in Asheville,
				drove out to Penland School of Craft and saw resident artists,
				Matt and Shoko, visited with long-time ceramic artist Norm
				Schulman at his wonderful house and kiln in the beautiful North
				Carolina woods.<br>
				<br>
				I threw my share of countless pots and gleefully cut them in
				half to see how I was progressing. Now that I am back in the
				studio I can see a significant difference in my throwing and I
				feel that I have improved a lot as I am applying the new
				techniques Tom taught me. <br>
				<br>
				I highly recommend Tom�s class to anyone wanting to expand their
				throwing skills, see an impressive collection of ancient to
				contemporary ceramics, hear rare ceramic tales from a master
				potter and savor the rich North Carolina pottery and craft
				tradition at the source. Thank you for an unforgettably
				wonderful experience. You are a very skilled and patient
				teacher. You were so nice, so thoughtful and such a good host. I
				felt welcome and comfortable in your house and studio and it was
				an honor to share that time with you.<br>

				WOW!! What a wonderful learning experience you provided for me.
				With Thirty-four years of teaching behind me I can recognize a
				fine teacher and you fit the bill. As an intermediate you
				quickly identified my strengths and weaknesses and then the show
				was on for two days of high intensity learning. It was great!
				Not a minute was wasted at meeting my needs. Also, you furnished
				the perfect environment including not only all the tools and
				equipment needed but also an absolutely beautiful, serene
				setting with virtually a museum of examples from which to study
				form, surface, color and technique. I could easily follow your
				organization and structure of content. The �attention to detail�
				focus that was woven through out the two days made perfect
				sense. At this time in my development of pottery skills it was
				extraordinary to be able to study under a master artist. You
				have saved me countless hours of trial and error. What a
				priceless value for me. <br>
				<br>
				The skills I learned were only part of the Tom Turner
				experience. The blending of skills, aesthetics, and techniques
				will serve to keep me focused on the pot as a whole. This goes
				way beyond just form and function as most dwell on. Throughout
				the two days both you and your collection spoke volumes on the
				subject of what turns a pot into a real piece of art. And yours
				are certainly art. <br>

				Hi Tom,<br>
				<br>
				It was truly three fantastic days of immersion in pottery art,
				materials, process and form. While I have had the opportunity to
				visit a number of famous museums which had pottery, I never had
				the curator take me on a guided tour and explain each piece and
				allow me to hold some really great pieces of art. Your
				collection is something that every aspiring potter (and some old
				ones) should see.<br>
				<br>
				Since I deal with scientists on a daily basis, I was amazed to
				see how much of a scientist you are. Your constant reminders to
				�pay attention to detail�; to �always be curious�; and to
				�understand materials, process and form� are traits of a
				scientist. I understand now what led you to test 175 clay
				bodies, to develop your porcelain body, and to build your own
				kilns.<br>
				<br>
				While you are a master thrower and have developed superb glazes,
				your attention to detail is at its finest when you are trimming.
				Your �awareness� is like the awareness in Zen. When you throw,
				you throw; when you glaze you glaze; when you trim your trim.
				You make trimming an art form. Nothing is hurried; the pot is
				not ready until it has �look� and �feel� you want. The lip and
				foot are often pieces of art unto themselves. The inside of your
				lids are pots by themselves.<br>
				<br>
				Tom, you have so much to offer and so willing to share that I
				hope other people will take advantage of the opportunity to go
				to your porcelain school (actually a university).<br>

				<br>
				Dear Tom,<br>
				<br>
				Thank you so much for helping me be more aware of the subtleties
				that make a pot look and feel more professional.<br>
				<br>
				Ever since I started working with clay 12 years ago, I�ve been
				on a quest to find the perfect pot and to acquire the skill to
				make it. Up till I met you, I�ve just taken baby steps in that
				journey. But now I feel I�ve taken several giant steps in
				correcting the flaws that you gently brought to my attention and
				helped me correct. I know I�m a much better potter since I�ve
				studied with you.<br>
				<br>
				I just wanted to thank you for sharing with me your �secrets� to
				throwing good pots. Since my pilgrimage to Mars Hill, my pots
				have been taller, and my bases have needed less trimming. That�s
				all because my walls are consistently thinner and stronger and
				shape easier. They will now complement my crystalline glazes.<br>
				<br>
				Every day since I returned home to work with my porcelain, I can
				hear your voice telling me that if I pay more attention to
				detail, the pots will automatically look more professional. So
				if I try to get away with little �mistake�, I know that the flaw
				will not go away. You�ve given me the confidence to wire a pot
				in half and examine what needs to be improved. Each time I sit
				down at my wheel, I get excited knowing I�m throwing better and
				better pots.<br>
				<br>
				I�m practicing your techniques every day because I want to
				return next year, ready to take more giant steps in my quest. I
				also want to give you the satisfaction of knowing how much you
				have helped me be a better potter.<br>
				<br>
				All the best to you,<br>

&nbsp;</font><p><font color="#333333"><a name="Chris Lockhart"></a>Hello Tom,<br>
				<br>
				It has taken some time for me to digest all of the information I
				took in over the three days I spent with you earlier this
				summer. Like a dry sponge I listened, studied, and watched as
				you gave as much knowledge and insight as my eyes and ears could
				handle. Being able to directly apply that knowledge to a wheel
				made it a great hands-on learning experience as well. The
				surprise for me was that the &quot;hands-on&quot; portion of the class was
				being able to look at, discuss, and touch the greatest pottery
				collection I have ever seen. The challenge for me would be to
				bottle everything I had learned and bring it back to Texas,
				because I knew when I got back I was going to question my own
				work in a big way.<br>
				Since your workshop my work has slowed down tremendously, but in
				a positive way. I have to admit that over the past year or more
				I think that making pots had become a numbers game for me.
				Entering the studio, the craftsman in me would go on vacation
				and put some rookie from finance in charge- &quot;Let's see, we need
				x number of widgets for the show next month priced at yada yada
				yada.&quot; But thankfully, watching you work this summer I was
				reminded of why I fell in love with making pots to begin with.
				It seems that you spend just as much time with a handcup as you
				would a large lidded vase. At whatever stage you are at with a
				pot you devote as much skill and expertise necessary to make it
				the best pot it could possibly be. The idea of making twelve
				mugs is no longer present when I approach the wheel, but rather
				&quot;I'm going to throw one mug- the best mug I can make. If time
				presents itself, I'll make another one.&quot;<br>
				I've had two firings since returning home with at least half the
				space in both occupied by test tiles. Your attitude toward glaze
				testing and construction has encouraged me to design my own set
				of glazes and I realize that I can begin with line blending the
				formulas that I already have. I'm also confident that with an
				original set of glazes, not only will my understanding of the
				materials be greater, but my connection to the process will be
				stronger as well. <br>
				I've also been thinking about what you called &quot;signatures&quot;. I've
				been aware of every mark I make on a pot; every glaze line, lip,
				spout, handle, and embellishment is equally important. I feel,
				for the first time, that I am making my pots! I can't tell you
				how much my work has changed since your class. I think the best
				thing that happened was that I was able to strip away what I
				didn't need and focus on what is truly important: craftmanship
				and detail on each individual pot.<br>
				At a festival this past weekend, at least 7 people approached my
				booth and said, &quot;Oh my god... this is beautiful... Oh my God!!!&quot;
				It was truly the best show I've ever had, not in terms of sales,
				but the response that I got from people was amazing. I can't
				thank you enough for the insight that you gave me and the
				inspiration to put it to use. I hope you are doing well and I'll
				look forward to talking with you soon. Thanks again-<br>

				<br>
				When I arrived on Friday evening, met you and had the
				opportunity to sort through your extensive collection of pots,
				it became clear that this was going to be a special experience.
				The weekend was a total emersion into the ceramic art world. So
				much information was shared that it has taken me some time to
				even begin to put my experience into words. My head is still
				spinning! <br>
				<br>
				I was impressed with the skill and traditions of south eastern
				potters. They produced some of the most beautiful, functional,
				simple and unpretentious pots out of pure necessity. They were
				definitely pots with intention. Seeing and holding pots from so
				many different potters that I had read about was very
				inspirational. <br>
				<br>
				Your studio is a unique place for serious pottery students to
				come and study all aspects of pottery making. Discussions about
				the history and philosophy of working with clay preceded any
				discussion on technique or material science. I think this is a
				significant difference between your school and past short
				workshops that I have taken.<br>
				In past workshops, the focus was on rushing through the steps of
				forming, glazing, and firing so that one could leave with a
				finished piece. In your school, the intention is not to leave
				with a finished pot, but to leave with a wealth of information
				that one can use to rise to the next level. <br>
				<br>
				Thanks again Tom for sharing your knowledge and your time. I
				would definitely recommend a trip to your studio to anyone with
				a serious interest in pottery. I hope to come for another visit
				in the near future.<br>

				<p>&nbsp;<p><font color="#333333"><a name="Maryann Carter"></a>Tom is an incredible
				instructor. I had admired his work for many years, but now I am
				able to admire his work and his teachings. I came to pottery at
				36, which left me hunting avenues to learn. My first instructor,
				Stephen Jepson had taught me a great deal, but now I had reached
				a plateau in my work. It was moderately good, but inconsistent
				and always just a bit off center. I realized that my real
				problem was not moving forward, but needing to back up and learn
				how to center completely. Tom was willing to work with me on all
				aspects of my throwing. We discussed form, areas where my pots
				were weak and really focused on making a good pot from beginning
				to end. He explained the entire process more thoroughly then I
				had found in any class, workshop or book. My work has already
				improved a great deal. Thanks Tom and I will be back for more
				classes as I have no doubt there is much more to learn.<br>

				<br>
				I want to thank you for the personal instruction and the time
				that you spent with me. It felt so much better to sit at the
				wheel and throw with some needed direction. Mental blocks sure
				can take you out of your game plan. Your new start and
				dedication is just one of the many things I admire about you,
				not to mention how you 'look' at a pot and the attention to
				detail, which may be your mantra, but you do what you say. Your
				thought process is remarkable and I am glad to have been a part
				of it.<br>
				Talk to you soon,<br>

				<br>
				Some time around 1980 I was at an art show in Maitland, FL and
				this guy came up and looked at my pots and finally said, &quot;I
				really like the way you lap your casserole lids.&quot; I'm quite sure
				that my jaw just about hit the ground because almost no one
				knows about using valve grinding compound to make lids fit
				perfectly. This person was Tom Turner and we talked awhile and
				then he invited me to his house in Lake Mary, just north of
				Orlando. The following Monday morning I was at his door to begin
				what has become a great friendship. I was just amazed at the
				pots that he had made. I thought at the time that they were so
				beautiful that they could not have come from the physical plane
				-- they must have somehow come from some astral place and
				deposited themselves in Tom's house. I was tremendously inspired
				by his work, and remain so to this day. He makes beautiful pots,
				honest pots, pots that might take some knowledge to appreciate.<br>
				<br>
				In 1981, I was teaching at Santa Fe CC in Gainesville, FL and
				Tom came to do a workshop for my students. I was amazed by his
				technique and the lightness of his pots, and also the forms, of
				course. He has a really highly developed sense of form and
				glaze. <br>
				<br>
				Some of his latest glazes are even crystalline in nature, though
				they are not zinc crystals. <br>
				See <img src="/images/photos%20a/march%2008%20firing/IMG_5180.JPG" />
				<br>
				<br>
				So this past weekend I drove up to Asheville, NC and took his
				throwing course -- 2 days of lessons and, of course, just
				palling around in the mountains and having fun. The highlight
				for me was going to an auction and Tom won a pot that looks like
				it might be a Hamada for 40.00. It was in a box with some awful
				pots and a pair of slip cast bird salt and pepper shakers. I had
				never been to an auction before so it was a really fun
				experience for me. I-bid-25-willyougive-30.... stream of
				consciousness auctioneer talk just made me smile from ear to
				ear. <br>
				<br>
				But the bottom line is that I was able to learn some things that
				improved my throwing. I did not have to change everything, but I
				did not learn correctly in the beginning so I had some bad
				habits which were holding me back. We got those corrected and
				Tom also showed me how to throw and coil porcelain for very
				large forms. We also talked about my forms and how I might
				improve them so it was a great time for me.<br>
				<br>
				Tom also has an incredible pottery collection -- there have to
				be well over 1000 pieces. For us crystal potters there were a
				couple of Marc Hansen's and a couple of little David Snair's
				along with a beautiful Tim Marcotte platter and a couple of
				mine. But his collection is a compendium of World Ceramics, from
				the Ming Dynasty to contemporary ceramics. There are two huge
				Korean wine jars which are maybe 3 feet tall and 3 feet in
				diameter. It is a resource that deserves a museum. It is worth
				the price of admission to just see these amazing pieces. Plus
				there are hundreds of books and show catalogs.<br>
				<br>
				Does it sound like I am encouraging you to go? I am. <br>
				<br>
				Especially if you are self taught in the throwing area. It's an
				opportunity to be with someone who makes some of the best pots
				around in a tiny class so you have lots of his attention. My
				class was one on one, but classes are at most four on one. <br>
				<br>
				I also came back with a nice pot. <img src="/images/photos%20a/jan%2008%20firing/IMG_4923.JPG" />

				<br>
				<a name="Anne Melvin 2"></a>Wow! <br>
				<br>
				I just have to second everything John just said. Two years ago I
				was looking for someone to help me move to the next level with
				my throwing. You know, faster, thinner, lighter with better
				form. Both John and Tom Coleman recommended Tom Turner.<br>
				<br>
				This lady cannot type when someone is looking over my shoulder.
				And I sure as heck had trouble throwing, even centering, with
				someone evaluating my every move. But the one-on-one experience
				I had with TomT as my tutor was well worth the trip and the
				money. When I came home, I found my pots went from heavy to
				light. He gave me the confidence to pull a wire through any pot,
				even the &quot;good&quot; ones, to see what I did right and, most usually,
				what improvements could be made.<br>
				<br>
				John didn't mention the detail and perfection that makes each TT
				pot unique, from the trimming on the foot to the pot shape
				hidden inside each lid. I have two of his pots which I check
				often to see if I could finish a lip, form a lid, or detail a
				foot better. Tom throws so thin that most of his pots over 4lbs
				are as translucent as the smaller ones. (I took a flashlight and
				checked.)<br>
				<br>
				Tom also has a DVD set of one of his two day workshops
				available. But the pilgrimage to Mars Hill is well worth it. He
				is a gracious host. My husband joined us each night for dinner
				and TT made both of us feel welcome and valued, as he showed us
				the sights of Ashville. <br>
				<br>
				I throw every day a litle bit better because I hear Tom's words
				going through my head... and I have his pots and DVD's to guide
				me.<br>
				Maybe I'll even try to meet that 6lb challenge... during a blue
				moon.<br>
				<br>
				All the best,<br>

				I attended a hands-on workshop with Tom Turner. I would
				recommend the workshop to any beginner or advanced student. Tom
				is very good at both showing and describing throwing techniques.
				I am totally blind, so I know I presented an unusual challenge
				for Tom. He was really cool with my disability! He showed me his
				extensive collection of valuable pottery and answered my
				questions about color and form in a meaningful way. Since I
				returned home, I feel that my work has gradually but steadily
				improved. It takes a little while for new throwing habits to
				become our own.</span><br class="style1"><br class="style1">
