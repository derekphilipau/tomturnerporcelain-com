									<font size="5" color="#800000">What is the
									American Ceramic Tradition?</font><O:P> </O:P>
									</p>
									<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
									<font size="2" color="#333333">Last year my wife and I made
									our first trip to Japan after 40 years of
									dreaming of such a trip. In Japan tradition
									rules, and here in the United States we
									wonder what it is. It seems they are locked
									into tradition and we are locked out. Back
									in the 70�s I was introduced to Southeastern
									folk pottery after 5 years of University Art
									School, and there I saw another type of
									tradition. I met and became friends with
									William J. Gordy and Lanier Meadors of
									Georgia; along with Dorothy and Walter Auman
									of North Carolina; Otto Brown of South
									Carolina and his brother Javon Brown and his
									son Evan Brown of North Carolina, and the
									many Coles and Owens of North Carolina.
									Tradition in Seagrove, North Carolina or
									Mashiko, Japan, is all the same, just
									different locations. It�s based on local
									clays, local forms, and local customers. For
									a long time I have been thinking and
									wondering what our real American Ceramic
									tradition is. Is it the Native American
									pottery; or the lead glazed pottery of the
									1700�s; or the salt glazed stoneware of the
									1800�s; or the alkaline glazed stoneware of
									the Southeastern United States in the 1800�s
									to early 1900�s?&nbsp; Is our tradition from
									Rookwood in Cincinnati, or Weller in
									Zanesville?&nbsp; Talking to my friend Mike
									Thiedeman about contemporary potters, he
									said, �Our tradition is Academic�, and he is
									right. For many reasons our teachers were
									not in touch with American traditions and
									the Bauhaus and Oriental pottery traditions
									were stressed in Art School. I believe as
									well that we Americans threw away our
									traditions with the industrial revolution
									when mass production became the norm and
									accepted way of seeing not only pottery, but
									all of our everyday items. This is why the
									�Arts and Crafts Movement� was begun by
									William Morris in the first place and why
									Leach carried it on and preached for the
									hand made item. Mass production replaced the
									individual craftsman as glass, plastic, and
									refrigeration replaced the need for ceramic
									canning jars and liquor jugs; store bought
									butter eliminated the need for butter
									churns; and the mass produced and very
									inexpensive pottery beat the potter to
									death.&nbsp; Fortunately for America, the
									southern potters did not industrialize and
									we still have areas like Seagrove and
									Jugtown, N.C., as well as the Catawba Valley
									tradition in Vale, N.C.&nbsp; Ben Owen III in
									Seagrove, N.C. has 5 generations of pottery
									making and customer education supporting his
									hard work today. The State of North Carolina
									has always supported the craftsman and
									around Seagrove you can see state highway
									signs pointing the way to local potters.
									Craft never became a dirty word down there
									like it did in the University system. Go
									visit Seagrove and Jugtown, N.C., or go to
									Mashiko, Japan and you�ll see the very same
									thing-TRADITION. Japan has had something
									like 200 generations of potters and we here
									in the United States have had about 5 or 6,
									but only in isolated areas.</font></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
									<font size="2" color="#333333">We had incredible teachers
									back in the mid 60�s who were not potters,
									but knew how to stimulate us and to direct
									us on our own path. We were taught not to
									copy and to try to find our �own way�. The
									only books back then were by Glenn Nelson,
									Daniel Rhodes, and&nbsp; Bernard Leach. Paul
									Soldner had a brochure out on how to build a
									catenary kiln and that was about it. Herb
									Sanders book came out on Japanese pottery,
									Richard Peeler went to Japan and made 16mm
									films of pottery villages, and along with
									Leach�s&nbsp; book, these were the main
									influences of Oriental pottery. As mentioned
									earlier, Leach traveled the world preaching
									for the hand made pot and in affect, he was
									our Pied Piper. He was a voice to be heard
									and a person to follow. At the Universities
									there was a little Bauhaus and Scandinavian
									design thrown in, but it was the Oriental
									pots that made the strongest impressions.
									Maybe Japanese brush work related most
									closely to the Abstract Expressionism&nbsp; that
									was then the fad, or movement in the New
									York art world. It was easy to follow Franz
									Kline and Jackson Pollock and Peter Volkous,
									Paul Soldner, Toshiko Takaezu, and Don Reitz
									all developed dynamic brush work on their
									pots. Don Frith followed more of a
									Scandinavian influence with his forms and
									surfaces, while Ralph Bacerra became the
									American Imari master with incredibly
									beautiful pots decorated in the most
									masterful ways. People like David Shaner
									developed quiet forms and decorations that
									were �theirs�, derived from all that they
									could read and see around them, but it was
									theirs. In the 60�s and 70�s it was not the
									accepted route to become a potter. There
									were no apprenticeships available except in
									England and Japan and most everyone got
									their MFA�s and were offered teaching jobs.
									It was an exciting time to be a clay student
									with workshops going on all over the country
									as Universities developed programs. An
									Academic Tradition was born.</font></p>

									<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
									<font size="2" color="#333333">&nbsp;But then&nbsp; what happened? The
									schools in their attempt to be new and
									different every semester, began to downplay
									pottery and leaned toward sculptural clay as
									being �more academically accepted as �ART�.&nbsp;
									Peter Volkous, the new Pied Piper emerged at
									Berkley filled with Abstract Expressionism
									and the classic pot was beaten to death for
									the next 30 years. Since the 70�s we have
									had a plethora of �graduates� coming out of
									school and getting teaching jobs who don�t
									have a clue as to what the �Art of the
									Potter� is. Pottery has been academically
									put down in the US for at least 30 years now
									and it�s been a big mistake. Today, I can
									think of only a few places where a student
									can work on an MFA in the �pottery mode�.
									Although once in a program they succumb to
									the academic pressure of �making art�, not
									�craft�, and they merge into the sculptural
									side of clay working.</font></p>

									<font color="#333333">

									</font> </O:P></font></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
									<font size="2" color="#333333">The big mistake was not
									allowing both to be within a ceramic art
									educational program. I know many schools
									today who will not allow wheel work, or if
									they do, it�s for one semester, before
									�advancing on to sculptural clay.� I realize
									too that many of us who really loved the
									�Art of the Potter� left University teaching
									because we wanted to make pots more than
									attend meetings. People like David Shaner,
									Tom Coleman, Tim Mather, and Don Pilcher to
									name a few, got out of the University, or
									stopped teaching clay. I left the University
									and felt that if I could make my very best
									pots, then they would be my very best
									teaching. Others climbed the academic ladder
									and became Department heads, or even Deans
									and stopped making and teaching pots.
									Fortunately for ceramic art education Tim
									Mather got back into teaching and is part of
									a great program at Indiana University.
									Pilcher, now retired, is back making pots
									and writing and the United States will
									benefit from that.</font></p>

									<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
									<font size="2" color="#333333">I am not against ceramic
									sculpture, I am against ceramic sculpture
									being toted as the art side of clay and
									pottery as the craft. The trickle down is
									immense. Who gets asked to jury shows and
									art fairs- academic persons. Since most have
									had no training or exposure to the �Art of
									The Potter�, they jury the potters out and
									put in what �looks new�.&nbsp; Universities don�t
									hire the experienced artist with years of
									experience, they hire the freshly graduated
									MFA because their salary is less, they are
									making what is on the magazine covers, but
									they have little experience. Secondly,
									without classes on the �Art of The Potter�
									we loose educated customers who appreciate
									really good work. People really want to
									learn about pottery as well as own it and
									enjoy it. Art Centers and private
									gallery/studios have sprung up out of the
									need for instruction. Early studios were The
									Torpedo Factory, 92<sup>nd</sup> Street Y in
									NYC, Lill St. in Chicago, and now there is
									Terras Incognito in Oak Park, Illinois and
									Red Star in Kansas City. These are only a
									few names of the many new studios teaching
									classes because people are hungry for
									information.</font></p>

									<font size="2" color="#333333">While in Japan we visited
									Ceramic Research Centers that encompass a
									Museum, school, and research center. They
									are about CLAY only and I wonder if it isn�t
									time that we do the same here in the United
